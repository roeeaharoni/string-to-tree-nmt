<seg id="1">Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"As go unions, so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I'm proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks</seg>
<seg id="6">Amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a reconnection with a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace, extend and respect labor rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, within the living memory of millions of Americans, when this country championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included language that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, with those rights under assault in America, it is wise, indeed, to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, as should we.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics</seg>
<seg id="2">A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept. 1, would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women's health, though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor, fearful for his safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abortions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3">Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lead researcher Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow lung, ovarian cancer</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers tracked the women's medical journeys across seven years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr Jordan said a woman's age at the time of diagnosis, ovarian cancer type, having existing illnesses and socio-economic status also impacted on survival chances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates.</seg>
<seg id="10">Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they're mostly based in major cities," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite improving tele-medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance, she suggested more fly-in, fly-out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status, the study found long-term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor, reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.</seg>
<seg id="15">The research, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">In March 2012, at 33 years of age, young Gold Coast mum Elisha Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Garden centres rue fall in homeowners</seg>
<seg id="2">The drop, coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35, could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core gardening age group," according to the HTA's study, which was reported by the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report, people renting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens.</seg>
<seg id="4">It cited the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens, the popularity of paving over front gardens for parking and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry, which is worth an estimated £5 billion in sales each year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Greater London, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has Britain's lowest spend per household on gardening products.</seg>
<seg id="6">The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society said that renting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: "Container gardening, for example, is especially popular with renters who can move their plants when they relocate."</seg>
<seg id="8">The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector's 'golden age" as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">It also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at Mallorca's public prosecutor's office on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The head of Calvià police on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot of Magaluf.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to online daily Mallorca Diario, the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at the office of Majorca's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Guards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Navarro.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spanish national daily ABC reported the disgruntled nightclub owners as saying favouritism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses.</seg>

<seg id="2">SPRING has sprung a wintry surprise on southern South Australia, bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.</seg>
<seg id="3">A further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm, following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short, blustery showers, including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="7">The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wind gusts were reaching about 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">That flight's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.</seg>

<seg id="2">Faced with runaway advances in consumer technology, which threaten to turn our homes into high-tech control rooms, our reporter, Bernd Matthies, takes heart from one electronic gadget that he really feels at home with.</seg>
<seg id="3">As I write this, my eye catches the spiral cable, which connects the handset to the telephone, and I'm thinking: Wow! How retro is that then?</seg>
<seg id="4">But it started me thinking: If the cable was not there, all the handsets would be lying scattered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more retro.</seg>
<seg id="5">In any case, in the elephantine (elephantine?</seg>
<seg id="6">No - a typing error - electronics) sector, the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rubbish tomorrow - once bought, it's out of date.</seg>
<seg id="7">And anyone, for example, who still has an old CRT TV in their living room, is merely announcing to the world that they're not interested in TVs!</seg>
<seg id="8">So why these thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="9">Because the International Consumer Electronics Fair (IFA) in Berlin, once again showed us how incompetent we are when it comes to questions about technology.</seg>
<seg id="10">The layman, who once knew, blind, how to operate a washing machine and a CD-Player, is today faced with highfalutin expert talk about an array of gadgets, the purpose of which he doesn't even understand. "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies," are what the press office promise us.</seg>
<seg id="11">Yes - and?</seg>
<seg id="12">What do you say to people, who clearly talk such guff voluntarily?</seg>
<seg id="13">Really, they've been trying to sell us the Internet of Things for our homes, for the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">So that your yoghurt can place itself on your shopping list; so that your fire-alarm can tell you - when you're lying on the beach in the Maldives - that there's a fire in your study back home.</seg>
<seg id="15">And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could set our home air-conditioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ...?</seg>
<seg id="16">Yes - but that presupposes that you have an air-conditioner in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, one dream really will come true very soon: We lift our wrist watches, and in a loud voice say "Vacuum!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot begins to hoover.</seg>
<seg id="18">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="19">Everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundary between white and brown goods is becoming blurred," mutters an industry insider. You can connect your washing machine to your headphone; your steam oven can send you a weather report; and your data-goggles can tell you how long your pizza still has to go in the oven - but that's of little use if you're sitting in a traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="20">From everyday experience, we also know: If you need a new model gadget to urgently work, the battery will almost certainly be empty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the telephone will out-live the next IFA exhibits in Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="3">The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are a little scared but we are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school.</seg>
<seg id="6">A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt a "little bit weird" to suddenly be going back to school.</seg>
<seg id="8">"There were some difficult times and we didn't leave our houses at all," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located close to the Gaza border, to offer his support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until a cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are hesitant about coming back.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire.</seg>
<seg id="15">He urged the children to study hard and said "we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security."</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="20">The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates.</seg>
<seg id="21">Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters.</seg>
<seg id="26">With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I hope the school will open soon to complete our education, just like the world's children and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school.</seg>

<seg id="5">That is a good development, one that should make us happy, and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the NPD in the ballot box, and not in the constitutional court.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Sunday, the NPD narrowly missed achieving the five percent barrier, which would have seen it enter parliament.</seg>
<seg id="7">A first attempt at securing a ban of the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003, because the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had informants in the top echelons of the NPD.</seg>
<seg id="8">In December 2013 the Bundesrat submitted a further banning action to the constitutional court, which is based in Karlsruhe, after spending a long time preparing the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">The German government and Bundestag did not take part in the banning submission.</seg>

<seg id="2">Refugees at Neuländer Platz will now be accommodated in tents.</seg>
<seg id="3">The reception centre for refugees in Harburg is full-to-bursting.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go-ahead for the Red Cross to erect the three tents.</seg>
<seg id="5">The local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These one-off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public, and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner," said, for example, Britta Herrmann, Chairwoman of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her party is calling on the Harburg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="8">96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reasons for the over-crowding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help, as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years, according to a widely-watched gauge.</seg>
<seg id="2">The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August, RP data said on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rise brought the total gain over the June, July and August to 4.2 per cent, the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annual growth in prices came in at 10.9 per cent, more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013, but the gains were not evenly spread across the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The RP Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the past year, while Melbourne's were up by 11.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price rises averaging between five and six per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the other end of the scale was Canberra, hit by government spending cutbacks, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">In an announcement to the regional German newspaper 'die Neue Presse' Pötzl contradicted the comments of managing director, Peer Medau, and said that the latter was behaving like a "military general."</seg>
<seg id="2">This was not the style of the college, he said.</seg>
<seg id="3">He said that the Medau family "were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July".</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time he also said that the plans were not about "final decisions already made," but rather about "stating preferences".</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said that the building work to widen the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Medaus feared.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine metre-wide road.</seg>
<seg id="8">We currently aim to widen it by 5.5 metres, which is one metre wider than before,"explained Pötzl.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pötzl refutes the argument of the Medau concern, namely that its cost-free parking places which belong to the school, will in future only be available for use by the college students.</seg>
<seg id="10">It won't be a case of everywhere being parked up, because we have time to find intelligent solutions, as has been the case with other car parks, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Think of the neighbours</seg>
<seg id="12">The children's nursery Bergwichtel, which is situated on the space in question, and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run, is "not to be impacted" according to the college president.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is far more concerned to point out "that it's not only an issue concerning the children's nursery, rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Strasse and the 800 schoolchildren of the adjacent secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Medau gentlemen," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whether the criticism by the parents' association for the children's nursery is correct that the extension of the road will lead to "one of the few remaining natural spaces in Coburg being lost," he said the "readers can decide for themselves."</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg regional building authority, plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 "and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context."</seg>
<seg id="17">Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's nursery about the plans, last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">Accordingly, the access for the new parking level will not now lead, as before, via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Strasse, but rather via the Medau-Berg.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, the narrow road must be widened into two lanes over a stretch of about one kilometre.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to higher estimates of the Medaus, the traffic in the Hohenfels castle park would increase ten-fold.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are talking of 2000 vehicles every day.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the town council refused to comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Glandorf retires from German National Handball team</seg>
<seg id="2">Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the German National team.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 31 year-old from German Bundesliga side SG Flensburg-Handewitt said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It was not an easy decision to make, but I've been thinking about it for months.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career," announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Facebook-Page.</seg>
<seg id="6">He retires from international competition with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">The powerful-throwing right-back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champions-League winners from Flensburg, and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head coach, Dagur Sigurdsson.</seg>
<seg id="8">Glandorf said he had had a "nice long talk" with the Icelander, who will select his squad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="9">His ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me, as I am sure they will also inspire my long-term teammates and my successors, too.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so, and the double burden of also playing for the national team wouldn`t allow me to do that."</seg>
<seg id="11">The left-hander feared his career might end in 2012 when he had a heel infection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Due to achilles tendon problems he was given a cortisone injection by doctors working with the German Handball Association, and this caused severe swelling of his foot.</seg>
<seg id="13">He needed an emergency operation and two further surgeries as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Glandorf then brought a legal action against the team doctor; however, this ended in a settlement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Twelve years as a professional and eleven years with the national team would take their toll on any player.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have some health issues I can't ignore anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">After three foot-surgeries within a short period of time in 2012, caused by infections, I have never been able to control my blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">I've also got some other minor issues related - wear and tear.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head, but I couldn`t play tricks with my body," he explained in an interview with German magazine Handball Time.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would only consider a comeback if really necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If we are in real big trouble, then I might consider it," the two-time father told the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="22">"But I can count the years I will continue to play handball with one hand.</seg>
<seg id="23">And I have to admit that I have become really humble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, when it comes to my health.</seg>
<seg id="24">After my career I would like to walk straight, to be honest."</seg>
<seg id="25">Besides the 2007 World Championship he also won the Champions League in May and the EHF-Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).</seg>
<seg id="26">He also won the Cup Winners Cup with Flensburg in 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of "Münsterland-Mooiste", which lead through the city on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The city of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzen riders" on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The largest cycling federation in Holland, NTFU, staged the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".</seg>
<seg id="4">In other words, the largest bike ride straight through Münsterland, a bike rider's paradise close to Holland.</seg>
<seg id="5">By registering, more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for having organized this tour through Münsterland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tour was advertised in several professional journals, and offered to those interested.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are from Den Helder, and drove here over night so we could take part in the tour.</seg>
<seg id="8">We would also like to get know Münsterland a bit better in the same way", the cyclists eagerly said, looking forward to the route through Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.</seg>
<seg id="9">After registering at the fraternity's club house, Sta.</seg>
<seg id="10">Katharina started off with a small "peace ride" through the city and over the embankment, which is also where the start line was.</seg>
<seg id="11">Then, the route, which was advertised in three different categories, headed in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld, passing by Havixbeck and Billerbeck, and then back to Horstmar.</seg>
<seg id="12">The riders prove just how good a shape they are in: stretches of 95 kilometers at an altitude of 1175 meters, 120 kilometers with an altitude of 1475 meters, and 145 kilometers with an altitude of 1775 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were fed and watered on their way back in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief organizer, Jos ter Huerne, and deputy mayor, Heinz Lölfing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are happy, and it was a wonderful experience for all participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organization went smoothly, with no issues, and there were no nasty incidents", Heinz Lölfing positively concluded with regard to the event.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped for, which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We shall see each other in 2015, hopefully with nice weather, on either 30 August, or on another weekend", the riders promised, but whatever the weather, they will return to Münsterland, and the organizers will plan a repeat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Konstantin Wecker - scrupulously honest memoirs</seg>
<seg id="2">The 287-page "Monk and Warrior" by Konstantin Wecker, song writer, pacifist, political activist and ex-prisoner, is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a biography</seg>
<seg id="3">Composed more as a collection of thought-provoking ideas rather than a chronological history, the author, who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947, has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable song-text.</seg>
<seg id="4">And he has been unstintingly honest throughout: From masturbating as a grammar school pupil to shoplifting and drug-taking, he has left none of his human weaknesses untold.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so tolerant towards his fellow man.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, abstract concepts, which he liberally uses throughout the text, take on a clearer, more important meaning: Love; Soul; Ego; Existing in the Here and Now; Spirituality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts, in a highly philosophical, but also very personal way.</seg>
<seg id="7">And he explains why he is pacifist; what lies behind his criticism of society; his political heart and soul; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and moulded - not only by music (he was an opera lover who became a soul and rock musician) but by his prison experience, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">He says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the monks, who live their lives by a process of "subtraction" whereby they "rid themselves of all things superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="9">In-between all the highbrow stuff, there are also short anecdotes of a more earthy nature - for example, fist-fights in a bar frequented by GIs, or else a crazy drive on the motorway, in which he drove full-on straight into a tree.</seg>
<seg id="10">And he's unsparing also, as he describes that too.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was "a lot" of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very unknowable.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: 'Stop the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of the stroke in cricket.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had a conversation with him like that.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was this unsmiling bloke in the corner, reading the paper for a lot of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a bit brighter now but they're dark, smoky, Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I walked round it, I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table, and my estimation of him went up.</seg>
<seg id="21">None the less, Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection.</seg>
<seg id="22">My dad never did hugging, never said, 'I love you'.</seg>
<seg id="23">It wasn't until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying 'I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">Having a daughter of his own, Billie, with Dawn French, enabled him to share the love he missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just stop hugging me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why wouldn't I be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mum</seg>
<seg id="31">He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn's a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mum.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was one of the things that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I became very, very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, 'You've got to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's tedious.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody likes eating carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's change in career trajectory is, perhaps, reflected in his distinguished, close-cropped beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has become engrossed in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">Comedy of Errors followed, as did Fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black impressionist/comedian on telly."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learnt on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985, whilst being a star, being on television and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny on New Faces in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family were very uncomfortable about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">I sort of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was a weird, reprehensible position to be in, I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was an "award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture, Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series, LennyHenry.tv, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels a bit like you're marking time or you're slightly going sideways."</seg>
<seg id="60">What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was on Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I wasn't really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very frightened of it.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Don't slag it off if you don't know what you're talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.</seg>
<seg id="69">It gave me the feeling that I could do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me.</seg>
<seg id="71">'This is what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.</seg>
<seg id="72">So the rehearsal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn't quite happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't quite believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.""</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer.""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can let somebody else sort it out.</seg>
<seg id="84">'You're in a play, stay in character.""</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic's quite good, it stiffens the sinews.</seg>
<seg id="88">That was well received too, so it's like a big sign from the gods, saying, 'This is what you should be doing.""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, in a BOOMING voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I'm sticking with it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I'm really loving it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has a comedian's brain, though - throughout, our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions.</seg>
<seg id="94">I'm just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you're constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to, but generally it doesn't float my boat like it used to.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he'll ever do another stand-up tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.</seg>
<seg id="99">So this is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like being an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's good fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You're always telling a story and that's a great place to be.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="5">President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="6">An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was lost in payments to "ghost workers" and other financial malpractice.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.</seg>
<seg id="8">All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise, a government statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll, it said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scandal surrounding arts advisor, Helge Achenbach, will be heard for the first time in court on 11 November.</seg>
<seg id="2">Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the founder of Aldi, Theo Albrecht, are suing Achenbach and two of his companies, who are in the process of declaring themselves bankrupt, for 19.4 million euros compensation in a civil case brought before the Düsseldorf district court.</seg>
<seg id="3">The news was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children need roots and wings</seg>
<seg id="2">He was a school teacher for 44 years, 23 of which he was the principal.</seg>
<seg id="3">During his teaching time, Manfred Richter got to know many schoolchildren who are now fully-grown adults living in Petershausen and Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="4">His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mount Sněžka is one of the best-known peaks in the Czech Giant Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today's Trutnov.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14, after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years.</seg>
<seg id="9">One year later the Germans living in the Sudetenland were dispossessed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.</seg>
<seg id="11">After a few months spent in a holding camp, they moved to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods train.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was how he came to live in Senkendorf, in Upper Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher training course was in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station; take the train to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months. Manfred Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cross Home in Bamberg, in a sleeping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951, he took his first state exam, and his second in 1954, after spending three further years as a teaching candidate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since Upper Franconia had no free teaching place for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Young Women's Room" was his first "Service Flat" in the school building.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958, he moved into the new-build teacher accommodation next door to the school, into a three-room service flat.</seg>
<seg id="20">Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="21">Until then, the school district association of Petershausen-Kollbach had three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the school year of 1968/69, these classes were accommodated in Petershausen, in today's town hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left in the locality was the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="24">In order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, could move into the present-day building, which has since been extended, after Richter took his retirement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor Götz was a great friend of the school," recalls Richter, with gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="28">Throughout his whole career, Manfred Richter never forgot a reply given in a speech by a government representative, in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice: "One should never forget to love". Manfred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.</seg>
<seg id="29">"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.</seg>
<seg id="30">But experience has also taught him that: "One doesn't always achieve that." Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children, is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, Richter's methods were at times unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">If school children got into fights, they were not given punishments like, for example, writing out lines or serving a detention.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the cost of the council, Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves, and then let the two antagonists fight it out, even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the benefit of the school, Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="35">Following his retirement, Richter, who had no political allegiances, was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="2">HR4-CYCLE TOUR 700 cyclists are taking a breather in the health resort of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten</seg>
<seg id="3">There is nothing particular out of the ordinary about touring cyclists take a rest in Bad Salzhausen or in Schotten.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, on Friday, the sheer numbers of those resting up was striking: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour, together with their entourages, were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen, and they would later be attending an open air party in the Alteburgpark in Schotten, too.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under the logo "Cycling and celebrating along the newly-discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker & Band.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Friday it was down to business: The riders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then further on to Schotten.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen-and-women were greeted by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had ridden off the start-line in Bad Vilbel on his own bike, and the boss of the municipal company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.</seg>
<seg id="8">All sorts of food and drink had been prepared, to refresh body and mind: The local women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 apple-, plum- and cheesecakes - as well as streusel cake which the intrepid riders let melt in their mouths.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Such cakes only the local women can make," praised the rider from Aulendiebach, at the same time as he ordered another slice.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnasium club, the riders could acquire cold drinks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from Operettas and Musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.</seg>
<seg id="12">The lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect.</seg>
<seg id="13">One gentleman even received a head-massage from his lady partner: "He certainly earned it - after all, he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off, earlier in the day."</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the mayor and the company boss still had work to do: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the watering-hole inn, the Trinkkurhaus, by reporter, Rainer Janke, and took their radio opportunity to give a big thumbs up for Bad Salzhausen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even head of promotions, Tobias Hagen, who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004, could only get a short rest, as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology.</seg>
<seg id="16">His pick-up truck, in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-strong Hessen Police team; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports, also needed a check.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The majority of riders come from the Rhein-Main-Region," he explained, "but riders have also come from Gießen and Fulda, from Lauterbach or from the Taunus and even from many towns in Westfalia.</seg>
<seg id="18">The number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay.</seg>
<seg id="19">Category 1 riders are accommodated in hotels, with Category 2 riders being put up in hostel-style lodging.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the riders set out again on the road, they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort: "Bye!"</seg>
<seg id="21">"It was very nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they shouted, as they waved goodbye.</seg>
<seg id="22">After arriving in Schotten, the group could take a short rest.</seg>
<seg id="23">But then in the evening, the riders were requested to go to the idyllic Alteburgpark.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under the guidance of manager of the Schotten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing (GTS) the Park had acquired a lovely festive ambience and, of course, there were plenty of nice nibbles, such as Flammkuchen with well-chilled Federweißer wine, too.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mayoress Susanne Schaab, GTS-boss, Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman, Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his capacity as board member of the Hessen-Thüringen section of the ADAC welcomed the visitors.</seg>
<seg id="26">The three were visibly delighted by the "roaring trade in Schotten."</seg>
<seg id="27">DJ Tobias Hagen opened the dancing stage.</seg>
<seg id="28">The cyclists were happy to have the chance to show off their dancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting feats on their bicycles earlier in the day.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appeared among the guests an increasing number of local people, who were as attracted by the pleasant atmosphere as much as the mass crowd of riders.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the second day of the tour program, the riders would call at the stopping points of Birstein; Wächtersbach; and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the sportsmen-and-women arrived back in Bad Vilbel once again.</seg>

<seg id="4">While there, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:</seg>

<seg id="1">In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs</seg>
<seg id="2">She comes trailing clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclaves of the Tory party.</seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, she has had frontline experience of her own.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began at global management consultants Bain and Co, then progressed via Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when the top job at its parent company Pearson's went to a junior male colleague.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her pay-off is said to be close to £1 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her political rating is sturdy, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whitehall: she became a cabinet office adviser.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Back in May, I described the chairman's job as a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an inner paradox to its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust faces in two directions: inwards as the upper tier of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwards as the voice of public concern and disquiet when things go awry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is an almost untenable duopoly calling for complete root-and-branch reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what incoming chairman would risk coming in, crashing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a difficult call.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that weren't tough enough, plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power, its finances and its status overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="17">As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certainties, the imminent negotiation of the licence fee is fraught with especial danger for the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households, and costs each one of them just 40p a day.</seg>
<seg id="20">What's more, apparently the Beeb's popularity is rising: 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed: I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days, and catch up on missed programmes with iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a much-loved and formidable institution.</seg>
<seg id="23">It needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post.</seg>
<seg id="4">A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down," the later post said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The caption on the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.</seg>
<seg id="15">His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry's verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously.</seg>
<seg id="19">After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, and the words, "Here we come South Carolina!"</seg>

<seg id="2">One of London's most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in southeast England has "reverted" to normal levels of activity.</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital have been the subject of red-hot demand and surging prices, with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of upmarket housebuilder Berkeley, on Monday said: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has reverted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013," adding that this offered a "stable operating environment."</seg>
<seg id="5">London's property market fared well during the downturn as foreign buyers piled into the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prices in the city have leapt 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to Land Registry data, far outstripping the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">Average selling prices on Berkeley's private, affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April's Mortgage Market Review, which introduced tougher lending rules, would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals in July, further suggesting the housing market is cooling.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptons International, another estate agent, has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London's most expensive postcodes, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to agent WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley, pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £2.2bn.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and, reflecting this, forward sales have been maintained."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June the company reported it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="16">Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £380m, on revenues up 18 per cent to £1.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Analyst consensus is for full-year pre-tax profit of £450m.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berkeley shares were flat at £23.96 in afternoon London trading.</seg>

<seg id="3">Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.</seg>
<seg id="4">A representative for the star of "The Hunger Games" confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and blasted the hacker for "a flagrant violation of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="5">The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The photos, which originally were posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, were purportedly obtained through a weakness in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and a purported "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not clear how many of the images are authentic, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" star Winstead took to Twitter to denounce the hack as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">"To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves," Winstead tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, Victoria Justice, of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were of her, tweeting, "These so called nudes of me are FAKE people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter 'J'</seg>
<seg id="2">They dissolved, that was the best way of putting it, they gradually came apart like a cardboard box that had been left out in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious, hard-going, intense, detached, and maybe a bit prickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then shook his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He recognised prickly.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was spiny, like a hedgehog, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest casualty of this spininess was an embryo-affair that had given greater promise than usual of relieving the lonely tedium of his life, and perhaps even bringing him some content.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired, quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern island village more remote and rugged even than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt, the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called, felicitously, Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">No one had lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes leaked, there were spiders still in the baths, slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows, believing the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbages.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a children's story cottage, threatening and enchanting at the same time, the garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist is announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father had liked listening to with the cottage blinds down.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet's too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">On account of their innate aggressiveness, songs of that sort were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">Encouraged to fall into desuetude, like the word desuetude.</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done, and just as, when it came to books, the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so, when it came to music, they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carried away by the day, Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn's big feet.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn didn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">This his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between them when he was small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, he'd told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew it was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard any.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz, too, without exactly being proscribed, wasn't played.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation had fallen out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was room for only one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be sure, when a tune began, exactly where it was going to end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Wit, the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictability unsettled people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was wit expressed musically.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew of jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular singers weren't black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or duress.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude.</seg>
<seg id="44">People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and sprinted.</seg>
<seg id="45">People originally from the Indian subcontinent, electronically gifted as though by nature, undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community plumbed; what was left of the Greek smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED was happening - fearing they'd be accused of having stoked the flames, fearing, indeed, that the flames would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and grew depressed with idleness.</seg>
<seg id="48">To each according to his gifts.</seg>
<seg id="49">Having heard only ballads, Ailinn was hard pressed to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was the expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except maybe to people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted anybody, but he delighted in this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He was saying too much, but the garden's neglect gave the illusion of safety.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still didn't comprehend.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father have loved something like that?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say it was a joke, but was reluctant, in her company, to put two fingers to his lips again.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought he was strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It struck him as funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief, blotting out Kevern's vision.</seg>
<seg id="62">Nothing to see in the whole wide world but her haystack of crow-black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing else he wanted to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say so," she said, unconvinced.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed in genuine distress.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet specifically, no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Your ankles, maybe, a bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's just the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon for that.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are the very reason I'm attracted to you," he tried instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I'm perverse that way.</seg>
<seg id="78">It came out wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He had meant it to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Meaning to be funny often landed him in a mess because, like his father, he lacked the reassuring charm necessary to temper the cruelty that lurked in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father intended to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Kevern, did.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his kind eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they'd been drinking.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderflower wine, so drink wasn't his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her agitation she seemed to tremble, like the fronds of a palm tree in a storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head's the very reason I'm perversely attracted to you," she said...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for her, both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she think he'd strike her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She hadn't spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he didn't doubt it was in all essentials similar to here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same vast and icy ocean crashed in on them both.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same befuddled men, even more thin-skinned and peevish in the aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twit them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They'd show her a thick fist, if she wasn't careful!</seg>
<seg id="96">Snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later.</seg>
<seg id="97">An unnecessary refinement in Kevern's view, since a snog was itself an act of thuggery.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt leaden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This wasn't the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he'd brought on himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaving the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a pang for him and for men in general, no matter that some had raised their hands to her.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well, when she couldn't recall a single instance, before today, of having seen it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">A score or so years before the events related above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow, the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood, prepared a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction, if not its cessation, was most to have been expected, given the money and energy expended on uprooting it.</seg>
<seg id="109">"Much has been done, and much continues to be done," she wrote, "to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country where, though the spires of churches soar above the hedgerows, the sweeter breath of human kindness has, historically, been rarely felt.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some qualities are proving to be ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it goes on engendering.</seg>
<seg id="112">The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gorges on stories of adversity overcome, and professes to believe ardently in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old brutishness retain a pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban conurbations, evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home, in the workplace, on our roads and even on our playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite," her supervisor said when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">May I suggest you read fewer novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also enquire: are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe I am not obliged to say," Esme Nussbaum replied.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Silence once more.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said at last, "because I have an objection to atheism, lesbianism or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of a prejudice-free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves, may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me.</seg>
<seg id="126">You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church; and those things you call "vicious" and "brutish," others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as though it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to sap the country of its essential life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile at your neighbour, cherish your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your telephone, converse, explain, listen, agree, apologise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand the points you are making," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that, if we are not forewarned, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="136">This was to suggest infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "in describing as "mistakes" actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far, as well, in speaking of them venting their "anger" and "mistrust" on "others."</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "others."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know of it.</seg>
<seg id="142">"In which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I make no accusations.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done ill, or done well, what was done was done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No more needs to be said - on this we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as there is no blame to be apportioned, so there are no amends to be made, were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what is the past for if not to learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past exists in order that we forget it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may add one word to that -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider your report," he said, dismissing her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, turning up for work as usual, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who had mounted the pavement in what passers-by described as a "vicious rage."</seg>
<seg id="154">Coincidences happen.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lesotho military officials denied staging a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.</seg>
<seg id="4">The premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the military was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom police were attempting to arm.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service, there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political, party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.</seg>
<seg id="7">South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions had the appearance at an overthrow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force, by all accounts the activities of the Lesotho defense force thus far bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lesotho military officials said soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and there was calm in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="10">Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing in control of the government in Thabane's absence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thabane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliament sessions due to feuding in his unity government.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said his actions have not undermined the government, despite allegations otherwise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eurozone manufacturing at 13-month low</seg>
<seg id="2">Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a closely-watched survey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A figure above 50 indicates expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a real concern, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring," Mr Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland, which saw its PMI grow to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially, and consumer confidence, and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly big-ticket orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said it was looking "ever more likely" that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Beslan survivors' decade of hell: Ten years since the horrific school siege, how the children caught up in it are still suffering</seg>
<seg id="2">Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world</seg>
<seg id="4">We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new term, it seemed like the nadir of all evil.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tragedy united east and west in revulsion, which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years on, we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.</seg>
<seg id="9">We discovered amazing young people, who have defied adversity, though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their greatest hope?</seg>
<seg id="11">That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop.</seg>
<seg id="12">The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym</seg>
<seg id="13">She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov wearing only her underwear as tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bewildered, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.</seg>
<seg id="16">'A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't,' said Aida at the time.</seg>
<seg id="17">My legs were covered in blood.</seg>
<seg id="18">I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum.</seg>
<seg id="19">A soldier plucked her to safety.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a series of surgeries, she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday: 'Three months ago, the pain came back.</seg>
<seg id="21">I fear I may need more surgery.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her aim now is to become a dentist, to help people as she has been aided by medics.</seg>
<seg id="24">'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it,' she said defiantly.</seg>
<seg id="25">'It happened to me and you can't change this fact.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too much.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.</seg>
<seg id="31">'I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.</seg>
<seg id="32">I will think about a family later.</seg>
<seg id="33">She says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand about our disaster, and stop this from happening any more.</seg>
<seg id="36">The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead</seg>
<seg id="37">He was on his first day at school (Russians start school aged 7) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then seven he said: 'Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'</seg>
<seg id="39">After one explosion he thought she was dying.</seg>
<seg id="40">She told him: 'Run'.</seg>
<seg id="41">Fearing she was dead, he fled and on his way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child by the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: 'I couldn't save her'.'</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.</seg>
<seg id="45">After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran in and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to be crowned a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie.</seg>
<seg id="49">'This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it,' he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still I can say that in my mind it is fading.</seg>
<seg id="51">I remember right afterwards, I threw away all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">'I'm not scared to go back in the gym but I don't think about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say they were killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and riding in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it</seg>
<seg id="60">'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,' said Damir, who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help so much.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to serve in the police one day and hope they enrol me to the training academy next year.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember terrible silence right after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London were crying when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to 'Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch soup, they called all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And we were just one month away from our horror then.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: 'I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">They are just the same children, like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not seeking revenge for example, he is not preoccupied with this past horror.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us, for hours at a time.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now, taller than me, nice looking, clever and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">'I remember I was shouting to him 'Damir, run, run away' but again I was so sure he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he did hear, and he did run away.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us unlike for so many.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgy Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004, while on the right is Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a senior GP, had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">'I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror,' she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not completely alone, we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not feel it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised in a statue (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember Georgy so much wanted to go to school on that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy says now: 'It's important this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">'I doubt we'll ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is moving to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">'I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no-one wants a war, so how does it happen?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little.</seg>
<seg id="121">It affected my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I got back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel myself a victim, this story is the part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will learn to be a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not let me.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgy Farniyev, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist</seg>
<seg id="138">Miraculous: Georgy Farniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">As the siege was underway, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is truly a miracle he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">'We feel as if it was just yesterday,' said Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, this is not something I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgy Farniev pictured today, with a photograph of him in hospital follwoing the siege on his laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">In terms of physical condition I am well.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now.</seg>
<seg id="154">Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including medical papers, and they replied it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have completed two years there.</seg>
<seg id="158">He is learning to treat all animals 'from cats to cows'.</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: 'I know I would never tell my children about my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is not something children should know about, and of course not something they should experience.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know Georgy won't go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home, not able to help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="168">It stays with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several surgeries, he walks but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This horrible experience will stay with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are those people fighting for?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="191">She is now ten (right) and has no memory at all of the atrocity</seg>
<seg id="192">The world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege cradled in the arms of a Russian policeman.</seg>
<seg id="193">Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother, ten year old older sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>
<seg id="195">Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl, who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost.</seg>
<seg id="196">Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the siege and has blossomed into a bright and happy girl, say neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="197">'They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids,' said a close friend.</seg>
<seg id="198">Ruslan is a fantastic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you're interested in shooting photos or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment choices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both go for around $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras, all priced under $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what gear you use, a few rules apply for getting the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Double-check your gear.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also, set your camera to match the type of photos or video you'll be shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, know how deep your equipment can go.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are rated to only 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots - because many of them won't work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, while action cams generally don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it's going to hard to see it underwater, and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So shoot multiples.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera has a bracket mode, which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different exposure settings, take advantage of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool, a lake or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Get close to your subjects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is great advice for shooting on dry land, but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's particularly important if you're shooting with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed, wide angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up, even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">A consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who sought him out, his wife remembers, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson understood that while doctors are captivated by diagnoses and diseases, those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May that year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I've had difficulty in energising myself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently berating his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually, and unaccountably, upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was up.</seg>
<seg id="12">He got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-ray came back.</seg>
<seg id="15">He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lung.</seg>
<seg id="16">With most cancers, it is hard to know the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Though some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost every case, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a voluntary industry ban came into effect.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">With an annual toll of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that, though asbestos use has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, embedded in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we are educated in, and the stores we shop in.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma is no respecter of class, wealth, occupation, or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bastions of privilege, from smart London department stores to public schools, have proved no refuge.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nor was he a pipe lagger.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he put his finger on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years training," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everybody - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, sadly, he was able to provide a partial answer.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will get this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died, on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To survive so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So now we can only echo Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have played itself out, some 90,000 people will have died.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most currently have no idea that they will die this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick glance at the reports from the courts, where those affected often turn for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread.</seg>
<seg id="57">This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people do know much about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "asbestiform" - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of the six, three have commonly been used in the building trade.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as White Asbestos, is by far the most frequently found in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seals, even brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it's still considered a "major health hazard" that can kill by the EU and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, are Brown Asbestos (amosite) and Blue Asbestos (crocidolite).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of Brown Asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is far from uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of that exposure, he says, is due to "normal occupation and weathering" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can be sure that they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report from Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, might have been exposed unawares.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be disturbed by something as innocuous as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given "a clean bill of health," it is now accepted £1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, upgrading electrics and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report noted that "the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All anyone can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places one has worked in, and the dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and in the middle of a late evening surgery.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I started feeling shivery.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came on very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="93">I didn't think I was going to be able to drive all the way home.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He ended up spending a month off work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays, and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment.</seg>
<seg id="98">Yet the condition went undiagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="99">Slowly his health improved and he went back to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he took exercise and was breathing hard.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of Abbott's patients arrived at his GP's surgery with similar symptoms to him, and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then Abbott didn't make the connection with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in that case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I tend just to plod along," he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">I hadn't worried about it too much to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worrying.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">That was when he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now coming down with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level, so patients are unlikely to have been affected.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many staff, walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eating in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott frequently did) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients, but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still being removed today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its marvellous insulating and flame-retarding properties.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Up and down the country, in myriad chemistry lessons, pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, items as innocuous as floor tiles or shed roofs have routinely contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case the only contact the woman sufferer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful how you pull down the garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The impact of diagnosis, knowing that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to sink in," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was at the surgery for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I won't see Christmas again</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was hard to take everything in," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my consultant "How long do I have?"</seg>
<seg id="143">I was quoted about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember thinking "Well, I won't see Christmas again.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it.""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious, because it is the mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in treating mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson, and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, "the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery, which is where the lining is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some feel it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't excise the pleura," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You can't get your knife round it.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer "is not very responsive to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but does not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Every now and again you get long survivors," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Happily, some patients do live far, far beyond expectations.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still battling on.</seg>
<seg id="168">After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, Cancer Central," he would announce cheerily when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Initially, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months, and likely prolong his life by just one month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I felt desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I felt like giving up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to put a slightly better tint on things."</seg>
<seg id="176">After seeing several consultants, Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor in thoracic surgery at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just rang them up and they saw me," Graham admits.</seg>
<seg id="178">The average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health.</seg>
<seg id="185">That is where company negligence came in.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-value settlement" since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma was down to asbestos exposure at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the inquest into his death, a spokesman for Guy's did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the basement area concerned was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance records may have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has created a £350m pot of money, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350m represents "a very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers" he says, suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened, and mesothelioma sufferers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven victims dying each day, quick action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery which, in contrast to Tom Treasure, he believes has a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt empowered.</seg>
<seg id="207">"That of course is one of the most important things," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see it in patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is some drive that keeps you going.</seg>
<seg id="210">When you give up you can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had my scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There was multiple spotting [of cancer] around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just about to turn 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">It's not life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's life ending.</seg>
<seg id="219">Once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no sign of the tumours.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I'm gone for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news you start getting negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard as a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to know what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn't going to become old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope, by even a glimmer of a possibility of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease carries with it (even as it did, eventually, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders; protesters vow vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing agitation for democratic reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision by China's National People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not unexpected, but it is still infuriating," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what Beijing promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They've lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it's clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending China's ruling, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kongers a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee tightly controlled by Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new clause, only candidates who "love the country, and love Hong Kong" would be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they did not give details, apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online statement, organizers said the movement "has considered occupying Central only as the last resort, an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters, with police and barricades deployed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">An influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest they are talking about, it could result in much economic damage, depending on how many are involved and for how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a perception that is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong's democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.</seg>

<seg id="1">US prom culture hits university life with freshers offered private jet entrances</seg>
<seg id="2">We're excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK's first luxurious travel service for the students of today.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make the maximum impact arriving at university, the company also offers transport options including private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Stewart also claimed the service had a safety aspect.</seg>
<seg id="5">The service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.</seg>
<seg id="6">Paired with our new VIF options, we're looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that "students will be booking the service over the next few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="8">The company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it still expected to find a market for the service.</seg>
<seg id="9">Students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations, compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression and VIF is just the way to do that.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Megan Dunn, NUS vice president for higher education, said: "This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis, with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials, before they can even start thinking about forking out thousands of pounds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attendees hold their hands up while chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage, Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on ferguson as a white woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But to Perez, it demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think you get a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege in such a high level way," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt called to voice something about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very emblematic of the crisis we face and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racialized, they have to call that out.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren't seen as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">To her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live the combined reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres, Angela Hattery, women and gender studies professor at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">You needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">To Hattery, the breakdown between white and black women came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Blacks would come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We haven't done a good job.</seg>
<seg id="25">We haven't helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">To Mitchell, the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play "catch up" to issues black women have grappled with for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have those [traditional feminist] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control?" posed Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Second wave feminists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now figuring out what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope women, who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well as gender, her comments on race in America still puzzle some.</seg>
<seg id="34">American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After U.S. border patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, immigration reform surfaced once again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that in order to rebrand the issue as essential for women, all she needed to do was share immigrant women's stories.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of employment visas are given to [male immigrants], the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was not only the gladiators that stood ankle deep in the mud at the park during Rheinbach's first Roman day.</seg>
<seg id="3">The appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain and autumn chill, and who were completely taken in by the historical show.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a colorful start with representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information on Roman times and their significance to the Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial arts group from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which, every time it stopped raining, seized the opportunity to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the soft sand covered arena.</seg>
<seg id="6">The owner of gladiators "Leonidas" proved himself to be a humorous and expert presenter, who sent men, one after one, into the ring for a heroic duel in a variety of gladiatorial genres.</seg>
<seg id="7">At first the "provocateurs" were lined up with a rectangular shield and short sword, as well a cuisse on the left leg, and a vembrace on the right arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then there were the "Essedarii" wearing a breast-plate, and carrying a short sword and a spear, as well as an iron gladiator helmet, a cuisse and an arm guard.</seg>
<seg id="9">What was particular impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who went up against the "Secutor" with a cast-net, trident and dagger, and who, after a short fight, knocked the guys to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">The swords clashed against one another, the shields clanked and the spears flew, zooming through the arena, so much so that you feared for the safety of the gladiators.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the gigantic "Summa Rudis", a muscular referee, constantly kept a keen eye on them.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life, and enable the culture of Roman times to be experienced", Lorenz Euskirchen, the chairman of the events organization "Freundeskreis Römerkanal" explained as the intention behind the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="13">Claus Wehage, the deputy mayor, announced in his welcome speech that after two years of preparation, the park was transformed for one day into an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the end, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings, which we can still admire today.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of these remains could also be marveled at during the Roman day, such as "Aduädukt-Marmor" from the eleven-meter high, and 1400 meter long, Roman canal bridge, which is the only one in Lüftelberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Frontinus organization compared, both then and now, the water and energy supply, and the managing director, Petra Fricke, said: "We still derive benefit today from the knowledge of back then".</seg>
<seg id="17">This was confirmed by the surveyor Ralph Heiliger from "IngenieurteamZwei" in Rheinback, who introduced the instruments used by the Romans for surveying, such as the Chorobat, Groma and Dioptra.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations of 1894, as well as bricks made from the original hypocaust, forced-air heating, which was once used to warm up Römervilla.</seg>
<seg id="19">The footprints of a wolf and fox from two thousand years ago were also impressive, and were left behind after they trod in clay before it was burnt.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2011 the office of archaeological monument conservation at the state association in Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman Villa in an industrial estate in north Rheinbach.</seg>
<seg id="21">The enclosing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a kiln for drying crops and malting.</seg>
<seg id="22">The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural manor, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.</seg>
<seg id="23">A range of finds from the excavation were presented in a glass cabinet, among which were a large plate, several fine glass jars and parts of a small necklace.</seg>
<seg id="24">Morscheiser presumed that the Villa was there from between the first and fourth century Anno Domini until the invasion of the Germanic people in the former Roman Rheinland.</seg>
<seg id="25">The children also kept themselves busy playing the Roman windmills game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote, as did the Roman pupils at the time, their names with metal pens on wax tablets.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the Roman thermal bath stand from Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves; at the Rheinbach glass museum stand they made glass mosaics; and at the Eifel Nettersheim nature center stand, they got to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone so they could grind the flour needed for a pita bread or muesli.</seg>
<seg id="27">The visitors rode through the park in a Roman carriage, which had been reconstructed to be true to the original, and pulled along by two cold blood horses, and also passed by the impressive city gym stand, where the results of their "Roman project week" were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="28">From 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg will also participate in a Roman week, in what is being called Roman Year 2014 throughout the Rhineland. The event will remember the death of Kaiser Augustus 2000 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="29">Together with the clubs dedicated to local, regional and historical traditions and characteristics, as well as the Wachtberg hiking club, the partnership association, and the Oberbachem amateur dramatics club, hiking, recitals, cooking evening and guidance for school classes, among other things, will be offered, and the Roman history of Wachtberg shall be remembered.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Roman legionnaire will, for example, talk about his drafty work in Wachtberg; plants will be presented as living monuments of Roman times, and a humorous lesson on the matter of international understanding between a "Germanic" group from Wachtberg and Roman invaders will be showcased.</seg>
<seg id="31">Adendorf elementary school has devoted itself to a week-long, Roman-themed project.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Roman week should, once again, enable us to experience the numerous and common, yet, at first glance, no longer visible, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg.</seg>
<seg id="33">Wachtberg town hall will give a small presentation on the sanctuary in Berkum, which was found in 1879.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ebola: The epidemic is putting strain on West Africa's economy</seg>
<seg id="2">The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a huge hit for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Markets have been abandoned, and international companies are keeping their distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">The devastating Ebola epidemic has dealt the economy in West Africa a heavy blow.</seg>
<seg id="5">Crops are rotting in the fields, mines have been deserted, and the markets have been abandoned. The virus has cost the region dearly.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even some international companies are keeping their distance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one", the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, concluded.</seg>
<seg id="8">Liberia is the most affected country</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is a total catastrophe; we are losing a lot of money", Alhaji Bamogo said, who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia's capital city, Monrovia.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or disinfectant against Ebola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Liberia is the country most affected by the virus; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever.</seg>
<seg id="12">The health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all corners of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The virus has even spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.</seg>
<seg id="15">Foreign businesses are pulling their employees out</seg>
<seg id="16">All over countries rich with resources, companies are suspending operations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even local traders and farmers are reacting: Only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to replenish their supplies.</seg>
<seg id="19">In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, where they have been put under quarantine, cacao and coffee beans, to name a few, and which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="20">The farmers do not dare leave their homes for the crops.</seg>
<seg id="21">Food suppliers are scarce</seg>
<seg id="22">"People are traveling less and less", Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa said.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, a man, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, is choosing to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="24">The population is, therefore, facing the consequences of the epidemic head on and feeling the pressure: Food suppliers are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="25">The supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling in the markets.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, the image of the region, which is heavily reliant on international companies, is under threat, and this has far-reaching consequences.</seg>
<seg id="27">The biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time, Phillippe Hugon, from the French Think Tank, Iris, said.</seg>
<seg id="28">What is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread.</seg>
<seg id="29">Investors may get the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and, therefore, also to invest", Hugon warned.</seg>
<seg id="30">The disease is also burdening the already strained national budgets of the States</seg>
<seg id="31">The disease is also burdening the already strained national budgets of the affected States.</seg>
<seg id="32">The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are being heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health system, and also by the declining economy.</seg>
<seg id="33">The African Development Bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tune of 60 million dollars (45 million euros) to the health systems of affected countries.</seg>
<seg id="34">The effects in Nigeria, where up to now only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed, are already noticeable.</seg>
<seg id="35">Yet the oil-rich region in the south of the Niger Delta is not yet affected.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming infected.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shooters are celebrating their 50th anniversary</seg>
<seg id="2">The gun club "Tannenwald" in Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preparations for the party are well underway in Tannenwald gun club, which will celebrate 50 years since being established on 12th to 14th September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The plan for Friday 12th September is an evening of entertainment provided by the group "Dorfrocker".</seg>
<seg id="5">The large cannon will be fired on Saturday at 18:00.</seg>
<seg id="6">Followed by a pleasant evening with "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" (Stoapfälzer rascals) in a large party tent.</seg>
<seg id="7">A brass band will be catering for the music</seg>
<seg id="8">The highlights on Sunday will be the festival service, which will take place at 9:30am in the parish church, and also the processions at 2pm.</seg>
<seg id="9">There will also be a ranking announcement in the afternoon for the national and county shooting competition.</seg>
<seg id="10">A particularly attractive sight will be the 25 festival women in their Dirndls.</seg>
<seg id="11">The festival band will be Berngau brass band.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mayor Wolfgang Wild and state secretary Albert Füracker have taken on the sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="13">The original name, "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" (gun society Tannenwald Berngau) dates back to 1907, when, on 21st March, the club was founded and described as "social entertainment by means of pistol and small-caliber target practice".</seg>
<seg id="14">In 1937 the Nazi regime closed the club down.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then on 30th April 1964, 19 young men founded the club again, and launched the "new" gun club "Tannenwald" in Berngau at Lukas guest-house.</seg>
<seg id="16">Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as range officers during its tough early years. The main objective then was to find a club pub and set up a shooting company.</seg>
<seg id="17">As early as autumn 1965 the shooting club started out in "Leininger" guest house with two teams competing against one another.</seg>
<seg id="18">The following year, target shooting was set up as a sport, organized into seven teams, ranging in ability, all the way up to the local premier league.</seg>
<seg id="19">The club records roll out every year, and the magic 380 rounds were set up for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just as the achievements of the active members has increased, so have the number of members.</seg>
<seg id="21">Once the club pub "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club, the club's management at the time, lead by Johann Rinn, decided to set up its future home in the basement room of the new "Landgasthof Härteis" (a country hotel).</seg>
<seg id="22">After 2700 hours of hard work, Father Strasser issued the blessing of the church for the new guns room on 8th May 1988.</seg>
<seg id="23">One of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 44th local shooting competition, which is linked to the formal consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 23rd and 24th April 1994, the shooting club celebrated its 30th anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="25">In 1995 the cannon group was founded.</seg>
<seg id="26">Josef Schmalzl was the head of the cannon division.</seg>
<seg id="27">Organizing the Bavarian Cannon Meeting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the "cannon shooters", and for the club as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to modernize the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngau courtyard, making it state of the art.</seg>
<seg id="29">Eleven teams go head to head</seg>
<seg id="30">The sporting achievements of the shooting club are also impressive.</seg>
<seg id="31">Currently there are a total of eleven teams that are taking part in the competitions: six air rifles teams, one pellet gun team, one KK1 sport target pistol team, one youth team and two old-timer teams.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first team comprised of Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was promoted to number 1 in the regional league in 2013/14, up from the local premier league (the highest of the shooting leagues in the ANB).</seg>
<seg id="33">The second team comprised of Verena Moosburger, Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml was promoted from the North local league to the local premier league.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to shooting, events such as Bockstechen, Fasching and Königsball, club excursions and also Christmas celebrations are all club traditions.</seg>
<seg id="35">The shooters also attend the parish and community festivals.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tony Stewart's return to the track has ended only a little over halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172, ending his night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then exited without speaking to reporters.</seg>
<seg id="5">His crew chief Chad Johnston said the 14 team was disappointed, but will now start focusing on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him," Johnston said.</seg>
<seg id="7">We'll go on to Richmond and hope we can do better there.</seg>
<seg id="8">Stewart first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night's race following a collision with Kyle Busch, requiring work to the right side of his car.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."</seg>
<seg id="10">Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded onto the hauler and the team was packed up and ready to leave.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dirt-track race in upstate New York.</seg>
<seg id="12">He decided to return this week, needing to win either at Atlanta or the next race at Richmond to claim a spot in the Chase.</seg>
<seg id="13">He returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the track to confront Stewart during a race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities said Friday that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">No decision has been made about whether Stewart will face charges.</seg>
<seg id="16">The three-time champion received a big cheer when he was introduced before the race.</seg>
<seg id="17">Starting in the 12th spot, Stewart ran in the top 10 early in the race, getting as high as fourth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then, on lap 122 after a restart, Busch's No.</seg>

<seg id="1">Merkel puts her foot down: "Let's be clear", tolls will come</seg>
<seg id="2">Once again the Chancellor makes herself clear.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, there is still no charter explaining all the complex details.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stiff opposition from the CDU against the tolls is making the CSU increasingly angrier.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following persistent opposition from the CDU, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of tolls.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Let's be crystal clear: They are mentioned in the coalition agreement, and we will have them", the party leader said on Monday following a CDU party conference with top committees in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Merkel has not, for the time being, established a detailed model.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Certain parameters" were mentioned in the black-red government program.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Minister of Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "made a suggestion, and we are continuing to work on it".</seg>
<seg id="10">The NW-CDU, however, is insisting that tolls on all streets be objected against.</seg>
<seg id="11">Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU), is participating constructively in the consultations on the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has spoken with Dobrindt on the topic and about further possibilities for capitalizing more and investing more in infrastructure, such as developing broadband.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There is nothing special about it". On Sunday, Schäuble let an article in the Spiegel pass without comment, which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compensating motorway investors with returns on the tolls - after the 2017 election.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the leader of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, warned about developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the Minister in charge.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deputy leader of the CDU, Armin Laschet, reinforced his objections.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and A-roads would get tolls", the state chairman for North Rhine-Westphalia said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that Seehofer has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Opposition to the plans has also been received from the CDU state association in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is due to concerns that a toll would have a negative impact on small-scale border traffic to neighboring states.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seehofer has demanded loyalty to the coalition following criticism of the tolls from members of the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="21">Die Linke (the Lefties) are considering the plans a failure given the arguing within the union.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The messed up toll is dead", Bernd Riexinger, the party leader, told the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung" (newspaper) on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"If the toll fails, the Minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce an obligation to have toll labels on all German streets as of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the coalition agreement, car owners in German must not, however, have to face additional charges.</seg>
<seg id="25">As such, road tax should be offset against tolls for them.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to EU law, however, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, an awkward gait and curled toes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition which had a very poor prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do.</seg>
<seg id="12">I could never roller-skate or skateboard with other kids and got bullied at school a lot because of the way I walked and ran.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rodgers said when she was aged 13, after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her feet, she took a peak at her medical notes when her consultant left the room which said that she suffered from FA.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I felt guilty because I'd been nosy and so I didn't tell anybody, but I did come home, look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral.</seg>
<seg id="18">She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities hadn't deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her surgeon about it.</seg>
<seg id="19">He just stood up and hugged me and said 'my dear I don't think you have it, as you would be in a wheelchair now.'</seg>
<seg id="20">I think you have something a lot less life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="21">After some genetic testing she was found to have CMT.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I'd drawn the lucky straw," she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Charity CMT UK has launched CMT awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Washington-area business owners" tax burden mounts as economy rebounds</seg>
<seg id="2">A rebounding economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">District, Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">Businesses" state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back-to-back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes rose at a faster clip, 4.3 percent, than local levies, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, at 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from business.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies" real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent bounceback in property values isn't doing nearly as much to inflate state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies" tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits, which don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on, for example, its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent rebound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recovering real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Business incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While trending in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses isn't growing at the same pace in all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The District's rate of growth was level with the national average, at 4.3 percent, while Maryland's growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions (all of which have flat corporate rates) at 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Maryland's corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while the District's stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The District wasn't evaluated in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite its advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, in line with Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year, the law could push the state's business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington region seem to be faring better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year, with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region's labor market.</seg>

<seg id="1">Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou</seg>
<seg id="2">Hops and malt - a popular combination even in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">German beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frankfurt's twin town in China would like a brewery, and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.</seg>
<seg id="5">German beer brewed in Frankfurt's twin town of Guangzhou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We would be delighted if a German brewery would set up business in our city", the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese city, Li Yiwei, said this week during a visit to the city by an SPD delegate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Time and time again throughout the conversation, the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="8">Guangzhou, which is also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China Li advertised.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, the people also have the buying power to afford German beer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation, said to the host that he would keeps his ears open in Germany for a possible partner.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You don't need a lot to make beer: good water, grain and a zest for life", he added over lunch with the senior party member in Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="12">This zest for like already beams out of Mr Li, he said flattering the host.</seg>
<seg id="13">After that, the official from Guangzhou clicked glasses with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine, which was served with dinner.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chinese brand Tsingtao has traces leading back to the German art of brewing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.</seg>
<seg id="16">More business operations</seg>
<seg id="17">A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, the deputy party leader, Li, said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lufthansa used to offer such a flight, but canceled it for economic reasons in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be worth it again", the local politician seemed convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow".</seg>
<seg id="21">At present, travelers would have to take a detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.</seg>
<seg id="22">The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital city is Guangzhou, is also hoping for a flight connection.</seg>
<seg id="23">The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish during his talks with the social democrat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"That is a very good idea", Schäfer-Gümbel answered - the Chinese deputy minister, Li Jinjun, an intimate expert on Germany, nodded in agreement.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well-cultivated partnership</seg>
<seg id="26">The affable deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.</seg>
<seg id="27">Li Yiwei has already been to the Main, but not in the capacity of his role.</seg>
<seg id="28">He only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even the party leader of the region, Wan Qinglian, had to leave.</seg>
<seg id="30">The action taken against the officials from Guangzhou is part of the nationwide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration, which was rigorously implemented by the head of state, Xi Jinping.</seg>
<seg id="31">Before his career in politics, the new senior politician, Li Yiwei, worked for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese communist party.</seg>
<seg id="32">Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was working as a senior official in Fujian, where car manufacturer VW has built a large factory.</seg>
<seg id="33">Frankfurt has officially adopted more than a dozen twin cities.</seg>
<seg id="34">Guangzhou, one of the twin cities located some 9000 kilometers away, is a connection that will be well looked after and cherished by both sides; for example, with a school exchange.</seg>
<seg id="35">Last year marked the 25 year of German-Chinese relations.</seg>
<seg id="36">The South China metropolis, which lies on the Pearl River, is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen thanks to its economic power.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year they would like to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago the sale of Twitch to Google's video service, for a cool billion, looked all wrapped up, and the pairing seemed natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their in-game feats; a "YouTube for live gaming," in Business Insider's words.</seg>
<seg id="7">Twitch's interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a genre of videos in which wiseacres give (mostly older) games the Mystery Science Theater treatment, are already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The point is, YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn, a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.</seg>
<seg id="13">To snobs like me who declare that they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3 in the morning as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some rando get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the games you could be watching right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are first-person, so watching footage of them, without controlling the viewpoint yourself, can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache.</seg>
<seg id="17">I concede that speedruns, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour, his Twitch channel isn't likely to be all that interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what do sceptics like me know?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How, exactly, will Amazon capitalise on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It's hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something any company would love to attract: hordes of advertiser-coveted young men.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Twitch chief Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "are both believers in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of shrinking, even - gulp - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">Something is happening on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest (castle garden festival).</seg>
<seg id="2">The organizers' idea was right.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the heavy downpour of rain on Saturday evening, approximately 1200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">Admission had to be stopped on occasion.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was annoying", according to Ron Sem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel lights and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem coined the name "Armula" from two Spanish words.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the open air castle garden in Salzwedel was supposed to beam out bright lights during the wide range of daytime and evening shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, you make your own fun anyway.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organizers promised a festival fit for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that is what they delivered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supplies stand located in the meadows of the castle garden, people from Salzwedel, but also guests from near and far, made themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="14">They followed the first live performance, tapped their feet in time, and enjoyed refreshments. In short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that goes for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whilst some people sprawled out on blankets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar, which had been carted in especially, others indulged in a glass of wine in the wine store, and the kids went crazy on the bouncy castle, which was a huge attraction for the little guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, even the children's face painting kept the volunteers' hands full, in the strictest meaning of the word, as the children rushed to become men, and conjure up fanciful creations on their small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel had organized.</seg>
<seg id="19">And then the rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 5:30 PM the rain pelted down onto the visitors; and families did a runner in search of somewhere dry.</seg>
<seg id="21">Despite this, the festival's attractions did not get called off.</seg>
<seg id="22">"More people than expected came", Rom Sem said, who called the event a "success all round".</seg>
<seg id="23">As such, nothing is going to stop them from repeating the big party next year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event, the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for Sem.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said that one annoying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="26">Apparently not enough security guards had been booked with the security company.</seg>
<seg id="27">The consequence: Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds.</seg>
<seg id="28">Feedback has been very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a preliminary and cautious estimation, the Salzwedel co-organizer estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound engineering.</seg>
<seg id="31">The hip hop band from Salzwedel, Blocks 'n' Rox, abandoned their performance somewhat unnerved by these problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">The engineers could not get a half-decent sound out of it.</seg>
<seg id="33">A shisha lounge had been planned but could not be built because the tents could not be delivered to Salzwedel due to a puncture.</seg>
<seg id="34">The organizer insisted that "they will, however, be there next year".</seg>
<seg id="35">The premier of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that was with bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be excused as it was their first time, but which have to be avoided next time round.</seg>
<seg id="38">The event organizers also had to accept criticism on the social networking site Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for twelve euros, I really expected more", Melanie Meier commented on the event's page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Unfortunately, you bit off more than you could chew", according to Ele Zimmermann on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="41">For others, the teething problems were not such a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rubbish, but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hats off!", Stephanie Jenß wrote about Amula.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the organizers have a year's time to address these criticisms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Will the Burgvereine (castle clubs) get back together again?</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boardroom is now contemplating the possibility of working together.</seg>
<seg id="4">As an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wolfratshausen, the deceased Richard Dimbath, the former chairmen of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde (Wolfratshausen castle friends), led the project in the French Guédelon.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up until a year ago, there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their points of view are now markedly different with regard to how the history of Wolfratshausen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two are coming together: There should soon be talks about a joint venture.</seg>
<seg id="8">Torsten Sjöberg (castle club) and Herbert Piffl (castle friends), both members of the board, confirmed this in answer to our newspaper's query.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have rung Mr Piffl and suggested that we get together", Sjöberg reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his opinion, all members of each club could come together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">This would enable quicker and more visible success to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whereas the castle friends, and the recently deceased Richard Dimbath right up until the bitter end, had their eyes on reconstructing the castle in the mountain forest, the castle club, with Sjöberg, want to "develop and bring the premises to life" in its original place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, the deputy chairman of castle friends, said himself that he was very pleased about the call.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has been presiding over castle friends since the death of Dimbath.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairperson will be found mid September during a members' meeting.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the moment, the club has around 40 members according to the 74 year old.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we adjourned the club's activities initially out of respect". This "period of thought" has been necessary to "think about how it can proceed".</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl, the new chairperson will then enter into discussions with the castle club.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, the castle friends can get on with the current atmospheric picture within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">Piffl said that, at the moment, they still do not have a candidate for the chair.</seg>
<seg id="21">"However, I am confident that we will find someone". He himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairperson should be in Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="23">The man from Tölz would, however, "like to continue working with them" on the project.</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view on the subject of reconstruction will continue to exist for some time in Piffl's eyes.</seg>
<seg id="25">He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar projects, which are well under way in Austria and France, show that this idea is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="27">But with a high number of participants among the population, as well as some volunteers from all over the world, it will become a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at first.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, with time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project". It could create a "unique characteristic" for the city of raftsmen.</seg>
<seg id="30">Otherwise, there is nothing here.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of reconstruction is, therefore, something that I personally do not want to simply abandon. He hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their aim to first of all document the history "is important and good".</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save on college textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My calculus book that usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often at a significant discount to buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade association.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $290 but can be purchased new for $239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not mind other people's notes or wear and tear, used texts are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is selling for $93.49 used on Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was selling for $48 new.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork.</seg>
<seg id="24">If so, old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version.</seg>
<seg id="25">Besides Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renting</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them, you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the length of the semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Know the rules of the store you rent from, including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes, highlighting, or wear and tear.</seg>
<seg id="31">Renter, beware: If you fail to return the book, penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new.</seg>
<seg id="32">E-books</seg>
<seg id="33">Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .</seg>
<seg id="35">Chegg will rent "Calculus" for six months for about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free, while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, shop around.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text.</seg>
<seg id="39">Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">He learned that lesson the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="41">A book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks, and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the box office</seg>
<seg id="2">Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 has made back less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has made back only $12 million of its $70 million budget.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Cameron Diaz vehicle Sex Tape took only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films such as How To Train Your Dragon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns.</seg>
<seg id="4">An article from Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that, when it comes to children's movies, the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="5">Collin called 2014 the "the worst" year yet for children's films, and described How To Train Your Dragon 2 as a merely "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when it comes to film pitched at a slightly older market, it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May's Memorial Day holiday and July 20, for 2013 and for this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results, which take the opinion of both cinema audiences and film critics into account, suggest that this year's crop of films are of similar calibre last year's hits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="10">Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's forthcoming Jungle Book film, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what used to be.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast to Hollywood's current box office slump, Netflix recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $1.2bn, almost doubling last year's figure of $837m.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted a Hollywood "meltdown."</seg>
<seg id="14">In light of the current downturn, some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it.</seg>
<seg id="15">With summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply "cyclical," telling Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box-office summer in history, and nobody will be worrying about the business."</seg>

<seg id="1">A few years ago, when the second table tennis regional division was canceled in an attempt to streamline the leagues, a step in the right directions was taken.</seg>
<seg id="2">Now, the German table tennis association has introduced an additional, third league into the program.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consequence: Any team that has not been promoted, has been demoted.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, Göttingen's top class team, Torpedo, avoided demotion in the premier league relegation, but will now play in the fifth division as of next season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Torpedo's women's team remain in the fourth division despite their superb clean-sweep in the Regionalliga.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Torpedo boys and girls are starting in the Lower Saxony liga, just like the lads from SC Weende.</seg>
<seg id="7">The SG Lenglern and Torpedo reserves are stepping up into the new Verbandsliga, but there are no longer any clubs from Göttingern in the Landesliga.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the women, TTV Geismar does play in the Verbandsliga, and the Torpedo's second team plays in the Landesliga.</seg>
<seg id="9">From a structural point of view, this seems to be a better regional division, when in fact, it is just the new Southern Regional Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="10">Stepping up into this are: TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dransfeld and SC Weende represent the area in the regional league, whereas TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and TTV Geismar II and III represent the area in the regional division. The Regional Premier League for women is at least kicking off with a good start.</seg>
<seg id="12">Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are all here as part of the party.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the regional league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are taking to the field.</seg>
<seg id="14">With each of the nine teams</seg>
<seg id="15">SC Weende sends a girl into the small regional league.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even the regional league's relay team for SCW boys, which is where Torpedo II is also starting, is not complete.</seg>
<seg id="17">As for the regional division, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV are heading into their season.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first season of the newly-founded regional association, both district divisions from Göttingen are starting out with each of the nine teams.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for the West relay team; that is made up of Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are some of the teams making up the East relay team.</seg>
<seg id="21">The women's district division is made up of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is much better than the district of Osterode, where there are no longer any female teams at a district level.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their potential. The innovative and bustling district committee are going to have to come up with something.</seg>

<seg id="2">Around 1000 protesters have been forced out of the PTV buildings by soldiers, according to the Minister of Information, Pervaiz Rashid.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a good half an hour or so, the station began broadcasting again.</seg>
<seg id="4">The director of PTV, Athar Farooq, said that demonstrators armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial offices.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no mentioned of the number of people killed or injured.</seg>
<seg id="6">The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Head of Government, accusing him of vote rigging.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police announced that on Monday, around one kilometer away from the residence of the Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, approximately 3000 demonstrators clashed with security forces.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to statements released by the hospital, a police officer was injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstrators attempted to gain access to Sharif's residence.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following a meeting in the army's headquarters on Sunday evening, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, stating there was "no time to waste or a need to use violence".</seg>
<seg id="12">The statement also announced that: "The army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the State".</seg>
<seg id="13">The escalating violence stirred up concern that the military may have to intervene, a military that has already revolted on many occasions in the past.</seg>
<seg id="14">The above protests, led by Imran Khan, an opposition politician, and Tahirul Qadri, a preacher, have been ongoing since independence day on 14 August.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sharif is refusing to step down.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Sunday Khan and Qadri called upon their supporters to persevere.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will not leave until we have forced Sharif to resign", Khan said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Qadri made similar comments:</seg>
<seg id="19">Khan accuses Sharif of having fraudulently won the parliamentary vote last May.</seg>
<seg id="20">Qadri is demanding the resignation of both the central and provincial governments.</seg>
<seg id="21">A provisional government should then reform the voting system, and call new elections.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than 40,000 members of the security forces have been deployed to protect the government district.</seg>
<seg id="23">At first, the demonstrators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament building. Then, at the weekend, Khan and Qadri called upon them to force entry into Sharif's residence.</seg>

<seg id="1">After its second win of the season, Hütteldorf is in third place on the table.</seg>
<seg id="2">A bitter week came to an end for Rapid on Sunday with a 2:0 win over Grödig.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached an interim low at the end of the Europa League on Thursday, said that "the victory is very liberating".</seg>
<seg id="4">The captain and goalkeeper, Steffen Hofmann, who climbed up to third place with Grün-Weiß, confirmed that "the sense of achievement was extremely important".</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel's dream goal has led Rapid on to a road to victory. Two winning seasons show that Rapid have reacted in the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki, and they reach the end of the international season with heightened morale.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive reaction", the defender Thomas Schrammel said, whose magnificent and skillful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought I'd build up all of the frustration from Thursday, and smashed it into the top of the net", the 26-year old said smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">13th of November 2010 was, until now, the last time that Schrammel had scored in a team from the Bundesliga, and that was with Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">His first championships goal at Rapid-Dress will, therefore, always be a special memory for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">"That is something quite special for me, I am Rapid offspring", Schrammel said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to Mario Pavelic's recent pelvis injury, Schrammel moved from playing left back to right back, where he also did a very good job.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had enough experience to be able to play in the mirrored position.</seg>
<seg id="13">He deserved the goal, Barisic stated. He has already achieved some assists this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The team shows character. Schrammel also crossed the ball over to Hofmann after the first hour, which led to the decisive 2:0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="15">But before that, even the fans could have kept the score.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we had some luck today", Schrammel noted, alluding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks: "The results were not justified, but the games were always better when compared to last year".</seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic even decided that the team had previously played "better in other games than today", and against "the strongest team to play in the stadium this season".</seg>
<seg id="18">These are the first three points since 26th July, and therefore prove that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that they have character".</seg>
<seg id="19">For him, what is just as pleasing is: "The fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again".</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of work was done during the internal football break. The unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, as well as the fact that Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger joined the first team, is what makes this success all the more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We must not forget that", Barisic said, who has lost players in the last three days, including Behrendt and Pavelic, "who recently were very stable".</seg>
<seg id="22">The international football break therefore has to be used "to lick wounds and to improve physically a bit", Barisic explained, who has five under 21s in his ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">For one of whom, captain Hofmann, the break came in particularly useful.</seg>
<seg id="24">He bends over backwards for the team, ignoring any pain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Especially during these difficult times, he showed that he is a very important player for us", Barisic stated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before being substituted in the 68th minute, Hofmann not only gave structure to Rapid's game, but also scored the second goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-year old, who played his 350th game in the Bundesliga, it was his first goal since November 2, 2013 (4:2 against Admira).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "We must not think that all is now well". "I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side, but, at some point, that luck had to come back to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was high time", Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of course, he spoke about focused and continued work: "You don't have to always see things black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">We haven't been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, we mustn't think that all is now well.</seg>
<seg id="33">His importance to the team is something that he could not deny.</seg>
<seg id="34">After all, it is a very young team, which, I am able to help at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="35">They hold on to me in certain phases", Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig's coach, Michael Baur and his team have little to blame themselves for.</seg>
<seg id="37">He is sorry about the quick counter goal, describing it as "a kind of magic goal", as well as the normal goal scored by Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongfully denied by the referee, Kollegger.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough upfield.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because we had far to few goals.</seg>
<seg id="40">Center back, Maximilian Karner thought the same: "It started off badly, but we then found our feet, and even scored a goal.</seg>
<seg id="41">All in all, we could have had more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Silence prevails beneath this treetop</seg>
<seg id="2">Last Friday, when giving out the puzzle on the summer series "My piece of Rhön happiness", we showed a mighty tree trunk.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are still several of these giant trees in the region; the example shown is the "Geissruheiche", an oak tree, which stands above the village of Unterweissenbrunn.</seg>
<seg id="4">A rocky footpath leads up to the somewhat 600 year old oak tree.</seg>
<seg id="5">You walk past enclosures, basalt cairns and a sea of stones.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tree is located just below the Bauersberg's stone quarry, one kilometer north of the street to Weisbach.</seg>
<seg id="7">The natural monument looks energetic; it towers above the other trees in the area, and, being more than eight meters in size, it reminds you of an American giant Sequoia.</seg>
<seg id="8">A small Buddha on top of a tree stub indicates that this is a spiritual or mystic place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite intensive research, there are only clues to the origins of the name.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr Wolfgang Schneider has, once again, consulted the Bischofsheim Archives, and asked elderly people from Unterweissenbrunn in order to find out what it has to do with the Geissruheiche.</seg>
<seg id="11">The results of his investigation revealed a less colorful explanation of the name.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to his research, up to around 80 years ago, the goat herders are said to have led their animals out of Unterweissenbrunn along the arduous, cleared and stoneless meadows.</seg>
<seg id="13">The herdsmen, exhausted after the ascent, rested at the foot of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since then, the area has won back its significance, because herds of goats, once again grazing the meadows.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, Schneider also discovered that the region has been declared the core area in the biosphere reserve.</seg>
<seg id="16">One should exercise caution when treading over the mass of stone because the sun-warmed basalt is also a popular whereabouts for the European viper.</seg>
<seg id="17">A hiking trail leads from Unterweissenbrunn up to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.</seg>
<seg id="18">Further trails are signposted, which lead up towards Hochrhön and offer an extensive hike.</seg>
<seg id="19">Where is the moated castle?</seg>
<seg id="20">A moated castle, which we looked for as part of our next challenge, is, of course, rather hard to find way up high.</seg>
<seg id="21">The reflection in the moat already provides a good impression of the structure, but we do have some historical buildings in the district, and the building portrait may just be a good example of this.</seg>
<seg id="22">Where is our "piece of Rhön happiness"?</seg>
<seg id="23">My piece of Rhön happiness</seg>
<seg id="24">As with the other Main-Post series over the years, there are prizes to be won again this year if you guess the correct answer.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you like to take photos, why not join in.</seg>
<seg id="26">Using "Stück vom Rhöner Glück" as the subject, send us your answer and your own personal "piece of Rhön happiness" to: red.neustadt@mainpost.de.</seg>

<seg id="1">After weeks of verbal wrangling Italy's Premier - and sitting EU-Chairman - Matteo Renzi, has managed to push through his nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU- Foreign Policy, despite strong conservative opposition at the special EU summit. She will be the successor of the Britain, Catherine Ashton.</seg>
<seg id="2">Renzi observes how the government-friendly daily newspaper, La Repubblica, describes the appointment of Mogherini, who was also seen as the favourite by the government, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and of his own position in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">He expects it to provide a boost for his "Reform Package" in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Renzi hopes, not least, to be able to thus quieten the left-wing party basis which is always stirring against him, for Mogherini is considered to be one of their group - albeit one of the more moderate.</seg>
<seg id="5">In opposition to the conservative representatives, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Pole Donald Tusk, who was named as Council President, were voted in, so the prevailing opinion in Rome, in order to achieve a political balance.</seg>
<seg id="6">For the Chief Diplomat of the EU will also serve as the Deputy to Commission President Juncker.</seg>
<seg id="7">The agreement of the EU-Parliament is considered to be safely secured.</seg>
<seg id="8">If this were not the case, then State President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41 year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) "an important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="9">La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has held high office over two decades in different governments, and who is known for her ambition, will be able to meet the "enormous challenges".</seg>
<seg id="10">The woman, who was born in Rome, is married and has two daughters.</seg>
<seg id="11">The qualified doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democratici di Sinistra (left wing democrats), which merged with the catholic centre party, Margherita, in 2008, to form today's social democratic party (PD).</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1999 Mogherini became Vice President for three years of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth.</seg>
<seg id="13">The election of 2001 saw her take high office with a place on the council of the Left Wing Democrats, working in the foreign policy department and then becoming its head.</seg>
<seg id="14">She was responsible for traditional cornerstones of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East; became known for her preparatory work to the operation of NATO in Afghanistan, in which Italy has a participating contingent; and she promoted relations with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she serves as an expert on Defence and European and International Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="16">When Renzi became Premier in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the PD today enjoys a better relationship with the strong freedom movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes for the Party in the EU elections, then it was Federica Mogherini who played a leading role in that, as is strongly believed in PD circles.</seg>

<seg id="1">France's Socialists should 'shut up and sort France out', Francois Hollande's key ally says</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to "show its affection" for the embattled Socialist president, whose reshuffle has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyality, he deserves our support.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It is our duty to remain at his sides," he said, to applause.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a placatory gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite inflammatory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mr Hollande had implored his fellow Socialists to remain "united" with the government.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, put a spanner in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for letting the French "lose faith in their future."</seg>
<seg id="8">Marine Le Pen, the far-Right National Front leader, heaped scorn on the Socialists' constant in-fighting by saying she did not see the new Valls government lasting more than just a few months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Francois Hollande the Emperor has no clothes, but neither has Prince Manuel Valls, forced to put together a new government when the previous one didn't even survive the summer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"And the new one won't survive the fall or the winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.</seg>
<seg id="11">She reiterated her party's call for a parliamentary dissolution, saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern.</seg>
<seg id="12">France's ruling party suffered a drubbing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May.</seg>
<seg id="13">A poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande's presidential term in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po university, warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing," he warned.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, the situation could further degenerate.</seg>

<seg id="4">An agreement may be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, cautioning that the talks could still fall apart.</seg>
<seg id="5">The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.</seg>
<seg id="6">The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are not public.</seg>

<seg id="9">It had revenues of $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.</seg>
<seg id="10">Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together have eight cruise ships traveling to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.</seg>
<seg id="11">It posted revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from the year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.</seg>
<seg id="13">Companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators of choice for these new customers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prestige Cruises registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.</seg>
<seg id="15">Apollo has been the company's majority shareholder following an $850 million deal in 2007.</seg>

<seg id="2">A group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby waving China's flag.</seg>
<seg id="3">The NPC Standing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership vote.</seg>
<seg id="4">All candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nominating committee likely to be stacked with Beijing loyalists.</seg>
<seg id="5">The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vow to bring Hong Kong's financial hub to a halt with "Occupy Central" protests.</seg>
<seg id="6">Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following the publication by Beijing of a white paper outlining China's authority over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on voting in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and staged a sit-in.</seg>
<seg id="8">Li's briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="9">The vice chairman of the Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were also due to speak in a series of briefings throughout the day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands Kiev open 'statehood' talks with eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battling separatists in the country's east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region's "statehood," according to Russian news accounts of his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory "Novorossiya," or "New Russia," a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is "a prisoner to illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to allay fears in the Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia's main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between Russia's Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">That has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steelmaking port of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway into the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are close to the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit took no definitive action; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Donetsk region to bolster the beleaguered separatists, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilovaysk by the Russian incursion were swapped Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Geoffrey Edelsten has vented his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude images of fiancee Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood A-listers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tinseltown is reeling after a series of explicit photos showing a nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in a major celebrity hacking scandal.</seg>
<seg id="4">The hacker responsible is said to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actors Kirsten Dunst.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Melbourne-based Grecko also had personal pictures allegedly retrieved due to an iCloud leak.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are 101 celebrity names on the list.</seg>
<seg id="7">Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting".</seg>
<seg id="8">All private correspondence and images should remain private.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's disgraceful that personal information can be stolen and dispersed to others.</seg>
<seg id="10">Grecko, who is in New York, reportedly told a news website the hacking was "shameful" and those targeted would "feel violated."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she is lounging topless in a pool.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palmer's film credits include Love And Honor, opposite Liam Hemsworth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning yesterday had no comment on the hacked pictures.</seg>
<seg id="14">A representative for Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a flagrant violation of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="15">Actor Seth Rogen lashed out at the hacker, tweeting: "Posting pics hacked from a cell phone is really no different than selling stolen merchandise."</seg>

<seg id="1">Cyclists, joggers and walkers took part yesterday in the 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Feldberg mountain, giving their support to 'Help for Children with Cancer'.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Tour was a hard grind for some, while others treated it as a light training session.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, everyone agreed on one thing: It was a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the very first time in his life the head of the Oberursel Brewery took his bike up the Feldberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">And for a good cause.</seg>
<seg id="7">He can put up with a little muscle stiffness, especially since his participation in the 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Felberg was in aid of the 'Help for children with cancer' association, and gave him a valuable personal insight.</seg>
<seg id="8">A great thing.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I now know that I can do it - brilliant!"</seg>
<seg id="10">You didn't happen to have a little break to milk the applause?</seg>
<seg id="11">No, if I'd stopped, I'd never have been able to carry on...</seg>
<seg id="12">Like Thomas Studanski, a member for the CDU in the Oberursel town council, many of the 718 participants struggled in the early mountain dew, coming close to exhaustion, but arriving happily on top of the summit plateau.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, some others found it much easier to complete the full eleven kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">Norman Diessner, for example.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Green Politician, wearing all red, from the municipal council - red clothes, red bike - looked to be taking it gently ("Quit some professionals here, so it's all about finishing!") - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without pausing for breath.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was another one who did it all in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson for the Oberursel Council, who did the route along side Frank Grüneisen.</seg>
<seg id="17">For both the triathletes the "Feldberg Cycling Event" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This one is about charity, and that's why we're glad to be here - we'd have gone out riding anyway today," Kuhn said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Along the route they met up with Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.</seg>
<seg id="19">The boy (12) had driven down to Oberusel in the morning, only to immediately go back up again.</seg>
<seg id="20">Florian Zierz from Frankfurt got himself into the saddle at 9 am; he "did" the Feldberg twice, before then wheeling back home.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another one who enjoyed himself was "Fritten-Toni".</seg>
<seg id="22">For the manager of the Oberursel cult kiosk, taking part in cycling events which go over the Feldberg is perfectly natural.</seg>
<seg id="23">He took just 40 minutes to do the route with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.</seg>
<seg id="24">A mad event.</seg>
<seg id="25">For this cause I'm very glad to be here," commented Andreas Balzke.</seg>
<seg id="26">The well-conditioned man from Mainz said he was an "ambitious racing cyclist."</seg>
<seg id="27">And he must be, since he was riding a "Fixie-Bike" which is a bike without gears...</seg>
<seg id="28">But it wasn't only cyclists who jaunted to the top - as was evidenced not only by the 20 walkers, who climbed up via the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also by a jogger who pulled behind him a tyre with weights attached to him by a rope.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mountain Rescue doctor, Professor Volker Lischke, who was there with his team to provide safety, and who was equipped with a four-wheel Bully and Quad, said: "I know him from Frankfurt - he trains for a specialist sleigh trail - it's just that he pulls the sleigh himself." The man is, therefore, in a sense his own sleigh dog.</seg>
<seg id="30">The 718 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="31">The walkers started at 9.30 am.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then it was the turn of the cyclists and runners, who began at 10 am.</seg>
<seg id="33">Five minutes later the first Mountain-bikers set off.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association 'Cycling on the Grosser Feldberg' gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjoyable trip.</seg>
<seg id="35">Next year, he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the Feldberg.</seg>
